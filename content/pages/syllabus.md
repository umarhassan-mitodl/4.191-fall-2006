Course Overview
---------------

What goes into the design of a building? Is beauty skin deep? Does it matter which way is North? Why do buildings look different from region to region? Who will use this building? Why is drawing not only fun, but important?

During this course, we will be exploring these questions through several short design exercises. Working with many different media, students will discover the interrelationship of Architecture and its related Disciplines, such as Structures, Sustainability, Architectural History and the Visual Arts. Each problem will focus on one of these disciplines and one exploration and presentation technique.

We will create additions to modernist structures, guest houses that operate off the grid in remote locations, places to experience art, and finally a project that will combine aspects of these projects into a community project in the Boston Seaport Area.
